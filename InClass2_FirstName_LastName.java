    // 2. Declare three variables: mass, acceleration, and force (all double).

    // 3. Prompt the user to enter the mass and assign their input to the mass variable
    
    // 4. Prompt the user to enter the acceleration and assign their input to the acceleration variable.

    // 5. Calculate the force by multiplying mass and acceleration.

    // 6. Print the result in a clear sentence showing the force applied to the object.
